# Front-End Development Group Project

The TikTok Youth Camp 2022 Camping Toolkit can be found [here](bit.ly/CampingToolkit).

The actual brief for the chosen group project can be found [here](https://bytedance.feishu.cn/docx/doxcnLQi3vdlVFnWnz7qxHwMzke).

## Instructions

Build a hangman game using web technology we have covered, including but not limited to
- Javascript, HTML, CSS, and React.
- Implement animation to improve user experience, including upon clicking buttons and displaying hangman.
- Any state management system.

> To learn about this game, you can refer to https://thewordsearch.com/hangman/.

## Requirements

- The UI should include hangman (after multiple wrong tries), input, words completed.
- The app needs to support mobile, tablet, and desktop viewport.

## Deliverables

1. Source code, with README on how to run the project. If git is used, git folder should be included.
2. Screenshots of game in different resolution, e.g. mobile, tablet, and deskop.
3. A video recording of the game being played.
4. Project report.

## Project Report

Project report should include the followings
1. Planning doc: including milestone, project timeline, and work allocation.
2. Technical doc: including what technology is used, why, key technical selection, and snippet of interesting code.
3. Project doc: including project video, key screenshots (in different screen resolution).
4. Project retrospective: similar to Scrum Sprint Retro, should include the following 3 sections:
    - What went well in the project
    - What could be improved
    - What will we commit to improve in the next project

## Bonus Points

Candidates are encouraged to use their creativity to build a more interesting or production-ready version of Hangman, some features could include:
1. Deploy your project into any cloud provider and make it public accessible. [TODO: add recommendations, some hosting may not be free]
2. Make the project support i18n and / or a11y.
3. Make your application more robust by adding tests, including: unit test, integration test, and end to end tests.
4. Build a bot / application to auto play this game.
5. Build a server to record more information, e.g. leader board. (node.js or server side is not covered in this course, but you can feel free to discuss with your peers or consult the trainers).
6. Make it a multiplayer game, e.g. two players can play the same game and decide a winner; have a matching mechanism; make it an online party game, etc.

We are not strict with the bonus points, but we will select one project for each category below:
1. Most popular one (voted by trainers)
2. Most Technical Challenging
3. Best User Experience
